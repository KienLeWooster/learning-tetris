# Tetris AI through Reinforcement Learnng

This project concerns itself with training an AI to play Tetris using reinforcement learning, and more specifically, Q-learning. Results have indicated that our AI performs considerably better than a player that chooses their move randomly. However, it is not comparable to a competent human player. The implementation of the game is adapted from  **[silvasur's reporsitory](https://gist.github.com/silvasur/565419/d9de6a84e7da000797ac681976442073045c74a4)**.
